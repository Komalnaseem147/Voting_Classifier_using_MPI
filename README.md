# Voting_Classifier_using_MPI
The goal was to build a voting classifier that combines predictions from three machine learning model like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine(SVM) to improve overall prediction accuracy and combine predictions from the three models using a majority voting approach to determine the final output for each instance.
